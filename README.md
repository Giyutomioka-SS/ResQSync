## Development Setup Guide

1. Download [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio?gclid=Cj0KCQjw4bipBhCyARIsAFsieCz3A1EeRIG97crAXWMC6_PYfbh25cP9Yvi3x1wZXnp3YyIG6-qtVPkaAmAgEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds)
2. Create a [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) account
    - Register for new Android application and follow the steps you would get your `google-service.json` file paste it in your root project file.
3. Register for Google Developers console and get your API key (required for Google Maps API) as you won't be able to run the setup without it.
   - To get the API, follow the directions [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/get-api-key):
   - Once you have your API key (it starts with "AIza"), define a new property in your project's local.properties file (e.g. MAPS_API_KEY=Aiza...), and replace the "YOUR_API_KEY" string in this file with "${MAPS_API_KEY}".
